# Nash-Equilibrium-in-5G-Cellular-Network-Selection-Games

[Poster](PosterNE.pdf)

<sub>
We study network selection games in 5G cellular networks and utilize a model which incorporates path loss. A client connects to exactly one Base Station. Each client selects a base station to maximize their own throughput. We formulate a noncooperative game and study its convergence to a pure Nash equilibrium and calculate the throughput for every client, and present an algorithm to discover pure Nash equilibrium.
